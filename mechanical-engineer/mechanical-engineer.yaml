            Your first task is to take a look at the following drawing. Note that
            the .dwg file is in AutoCAD format, so you will need to use AutoCAD-compatible
            software to open it.

            As a warm up, take close look at the diagram with the cutting plane D.
            Could you help me model this in SolidWorks?
