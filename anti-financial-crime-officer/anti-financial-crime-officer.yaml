            The Anti-Financial-Crime team helps banks and their clients tackle
            general criminal threats and other high-risk activity.

            **How the sub-teams break down**
            ‚Ä¢ *Policy*: interpret regulations and brief the business  
            ‚Ä¢ *Ops & Analytics*: run day-to-day monitoring and risk assessment  
            ‚Ä¢ *Investigations (FCIU/FIU)*: deep-dive intelligence work

            You'll work mainly with Ops and FCIU, so no need to master every
            regulation at once.  
            Your goal today is simply to learn how banks detect and prevent
            financial crime.

            Think of it this way: if you stole \$100, dumping it into your
            account in one go looks fishy. But splitting it into \$20 transfers
            over a month makes it blend in. That‚Äôs a simple laundering tactic.

            That's clearly legit, so we‚Äôd let it through.

            A loan facility is a legal agreement that lets a borrower draw down
            funds. It spells out covenants, repayment terms, and AML clauses.
