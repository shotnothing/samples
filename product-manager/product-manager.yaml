            Phew â€“ you arrived just in time!

            Marketing needs two quick queries for tonight's board deck.

            **SQL Crash-Course**  
            â€¢ **SELECT** â€“ choose columns or calculations  
            â€¢ **FROM** â€“ pick the table  
            â€¢ **WHERE** â€“ filter rows  
            â€¢ **COUNT(*)** â€“ count rows  
            â€¢ **ORDER BY ... DESC** â€“ newest â†’ oldest  
            â€¢ **LIMIT 5** â€“ take the first five rows

            ***Getting connected***  
            1. Create a free MotherDuck account.  
            2. New cell â†’
               ```sql
               ATTACH 'md:_share/dayone_db/dde544fd-0f4f-4bde-b02c-579582bf02e9';
               ```  
            3. Verify connection with:
               ```sql
               SELECT COUNT(*) FROM viditation_user_big;
               ```

            **Questions to answer**

            **Q1 â€“ Singapore users**  
            ```sql
            SELECT COUNT(*) AS sg_users
            FROM   viditation_user_big
            WHERE  country_iso = '???';  -- replace ??? with SG
            ```

            **Q2 â€“ Five newest sign-ups**  
            ```sql
            SELECT user_id, created_date
            FROM   viditation_user_big
            ORDER BY created_date DESC
            LIMIT 5;
