            The Anti-Financial-Crime team helps banks and their clients tackle
            general criminal threats and other high-risk activity.

            **How the sub-teams break down**
            ‚Ä¢ *Policy*: interpret regulations and brief the business  
            ‚Ä¢ *Ops & Analytics*: run day-to-day monitoring and risk assessment  
            ‚Ä¢ *Investigations (FCIU/FIU)*: deep-dive intelligence work

            You'll work mainly with Ops and FCIU, so no need to master every
            regulation at once.  
            Your goal today is simply to learn how banks detect and prevent
            financial crime.

            Think of it this way: if you stole \$100, dumping it into your
            account in one go looks fishy. But splitting it into \$20 transfers
            over a month makes it blend in. That‚Äôs a simple laundering tactic.

            We‚Äôre the bank in charge of your account, so you‚Äôd tell us to send

            That's clearly legit, so we‚Äôd let it through.

            A loan facility is a legal agreement that lets a borrower draw down
            funds. It spells out covenants, repayment terms, and AML clauses.

            Good try, but the problematic one is LA_003_UK. Keep the guidebook
            handy next time.

            Transaction ID 304. We‚Äôre worried about the transfers between
            ACC401-403. Joseph and Sarah are related, but another account,
            Laura Smith, is also involved.

            Joseph sent two identical SGD8,000 payments to Laura in quick
            succession. That‚Äôs odd, but not enough to freeze for now.

            Policy says we should re-confirm the relationship if this pattern
            continues. If they‚Äôre family, we can tag that in the network, and we won't have to freeze it.

            Open Link Analysis in OneLink (top-right), see if they overlap
            in our database. If yes, add the ‚ÄúFamily‚Äù relationship, then tell
            me whether to Freeze or Release the transaction.

            Great! Your intuition is on point. Link analysis shows they share
            last name, phone, and address, and both connect to Sarah ‚Äî looks
            like family.

            I see why you froze it, but the evidence leans toward a family link
            rather than anything criminal. Link analysis shows shared last
            name, phone, and address, and both have a familial relationship to Sarah ‚Äî looks
            like family.
